# Internal-Combustion-Engine-Modeling
This project was for the Mechanical Engineering Systems Laboratory course, and modeled an internal combustion engine. 


The following steps were taken:
1. Calibrated the torque sensor given a series of readings under different loads
2. Created mathematical relationships that relate various engine component motions to the quantities that were measured
4. Processed the collected data in order to infer relationships between torque and RPM
5. Calculated the magnitude of the negative work the engine experiences from friction and the resulting torque of friction
6. Estimated a value of the moment of inertia of the system (the flywheel) for use in subsequent modeling
